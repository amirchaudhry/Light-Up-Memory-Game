## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [www.javapoint.com was useful to read more about Html.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [The biggest challenge that I encountered while creating this program was getting familiar with Html and javascript language. This is my
   first time I ever used Html or js to write any application but it was really fun and easy to learn about it. I read all the information and
   description given with the steps to learn about basics such as < p > is a tag element which represents the paragraph of text or < a > represents
   anchor and a lot more elements. While writing the program I reminded myself what each line or symbol means or what is its function.
   In the .css class, I played around with fonts, colors, button size, and style to explore all different combinations. In the script class,
   I struggled the most in understanding all parts and putting them together. I read and tried to understand all the references given with the
   description for the script class. It was a little hard at first but after understanding the basics, writing the code was fun and simpler than
   writing in any other language. So the biggest challenge I faced was not having familiarity with the language but after doing some reading and work,
   I realized that it was one of the most fun learning experiences I had.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [Since this was my first time, doing a project like this and I am very new to this, which languages you should work on most to be good at web development?
   What are some of the tips that can help you while learning about web development? What are some of the common problems people face while web development?
   And what are some ways or best approaches to use Html and javascript to solve problems? As a beginner, what should I do to make myself better at Html and js,
   or what would be the best way to learn it so I can apply it efficiently later? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I have few more hours to work I would spend time adding optional features mentioned in the description of the pre-work. I would like to add more buttons, speed up the clue playback timer, and
   function which would allow users to make a specific number of mistakes. I would also like to work on the design of buttons by adding images and play with the audio to learn more about it. Another
   function I would like to work on would be a scoring system where the user would be able to see the number of correct guesses made on the screen. ]
